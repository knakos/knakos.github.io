# Konstantinos Nakos - Personal GitHub Page

This repository contains the source code for my personal GitHub Pages website.

## Project Structure

The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - All styling for the website
- `script.js` - Interactive functionality
- `images/` - Directory containing all image assets

## Setup and Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages. To set up your own version:

1. Fork this repository
2. Rename it to `yourusername.github.io`
3. Update the content with your personal information
4. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings

## Local Development

To run this site locally:

# Navigate to the project directory
cd knakos.github.io

# Open in your browser
# You can use any local server like:
python -m http.server
```

## Image Placeholders

For development, you'll need to replace the following image placeholders:
